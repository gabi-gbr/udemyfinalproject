# Getting Started with Create React App

# Udemy Clone (React)

A clone of Udemy built as a final project for a Frontend Web Development course.  
The project helped me practice **React**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **state management**, and **React Router**.

I learned a lot about React components, state management, and routing while working on this project.
